# KDD Cup 99 Data

This dataset is a cleaned and reformatted version of the original [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) dataset.
**License**: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 — see full terms at the bottom of this page.

## Usage

- **Multiclass classification** (40-class and 5-class versions).
- **Binary classification** (attack and normal).
- **Unsupervised anomaly detection** (using unlabeled data).

## Original task description

**Task**: Build a network intrusion detector that distinguishes between "normal" and "attack" connections.
**Features**: 41 attributes capturing characteristics of network connections, such as duration, protocol, number of failed logins, etc.
**Target (label)**: One of 40 connection types, including normal traffic and various attack categories (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R).

## Dataset Modifications

This version of the dataset includes the following modifications:

- Converted the original 40-class label into:
  - **5-class version** by grouping connection types into: `dos`, `probe`, `r2l`, `u2r`, `normal`.
  - **binary version** by labeling all attacks as `attack` and keeping `normal` as-is.
- Added feature `connection_type` as target label for classification.
- For clean versions, the `num_outbound_cmds` feature has been removed.

## Features description

> ⚠️ **Important note on label distribution across sets**
>
> There is a significant mismatch between the training/full and test sets in the full 40-class version of the dataset:
>
> - The **training/full sets** contains 22 attack types + `normal`, totaling **23 labels**.
> - The **test set** contains 37 attack types + `normal`, totaling **38 labels**.
> - The **combined set of labels** contains **40 labels**.
>
> **2 attack types** appear **only in the train and full sets**: `warezclient`,`spy`.
>
> **17 attack types** appear **only in the test set**: `xlock`, `ps`, `xterm`, `processtable`, `snmpguess`, `sqlattack`, `httptunnel`, `mscan`, `worm`, `apache2`, `snmpgetattack`, `saint`, `sendmail`, `mailbomb`, `xsnoop`, `udpstorm`, `named`.
